boggle-solver
=============

Currently, if you clone this repo into a folder and run boggle_solver.rb, the code will load an English dictionary into a trie, create and "solve" 1000 Boggle boards, and output the number of words found, the longest word, and the running time for the Boggle-solving part (the dictionary takes around 7 seconds to load).
